* Research annotation tools
** Requirements
   * Input / Output annotations in JSON format
   * Dynamically add new labels
** DONE Brat
   CLOSED: [2018-05-20 Sun 20:41]
   * FREE
   * Annotations written to text .ann files. The format is simple enough that a simple script can be used to extract them into any required JSON format.
   * Unable to handle HTML. Requires .txt files as input
   * Does not support dynamic creation of new labels. Requires setting up a configuration file containing the details of the kinds of annotations and any validations if required.
   * Supports text span (entity) annotations, relation annotations, event (n-ary relation) annotations
   * Allows multi-user setup with logins
   * Supports some keyoard shortcuts but mainly required extensive mouse usage.
   * Nice search and annotation editing features
   * Simple intuitive and nice visualization features
 
** Stanford Manual Annotation Tool
*** FREE
*** Really outdated
*** Not browser based. Runs a JAVA GUI application on the local machine.
*** Can create labels on the fly and export them as tag files. Tag files are just text files that contain a label and its colour on each line.
*** No HTML support
** Tagtog
   * Paid
   * Really nice and simple online tool with API access for annotations
   * HTML processing in beta
     - Takes in HTML (even directly by specifying the URL)
     - Converts the HTML into a new HTML text document divided into ~<section>~s and ~<p>~s
     - This is the text which gets annotated section wise
     - Seems to work reasonably for a few articles
